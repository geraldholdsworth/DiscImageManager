* ADFS S, M, L, D, E and F Directories can now be re-titled, including the root.
* Files and entire directories can now be deleted from ADFS S, M, L and D images.
* Changed some assumptions when ID-ing DFS images (number of tracks no longer has to be 40 or 80). Due to this have had to introduce an extra check (number of sectors >0) when ID-ing DFS images.
* Changed the order of ID-ing images as Commodore and Amiga could now be mistaken for DFS.

Bug fixes
* Ironed out a couple of ADFS ID-ing bugs.
* The image file size was not extended to the full extent of the disc size when adding files or directories.
* Fixed a bug when ID-ing formats to ensure one already 'claimed' for a platform does not undergo further checks for other formats.

1.05.10 23rd January 2021
-------------------------
New or improved features
* Creation of new module, introducing separate layer between the UI and the class.

* Updated the ADFS directory checksum checking - now only ignores a zero checksum for old directories.

Bug fixes
* Found, and fixed, a major bug whereby if a file was fragmented on an ADFS New Map image, the resultant extraction of the file could be corrupted.
* Fixed a bug (or more accurately, an oversight) where the checksums where not computed and saved when retitling New Directory directories, resulting in Broken Directory errors.
* New directories being added in ADFS New Directory formats were not getting their checksum updated, resulting in a Broken Directory.

-------------------------
New or improved features

* Application now reports which platform and architecture the build was built on (e.g. macOS 64 bit) in the About Box.
* More detailed errors are reported when writing files or directories and they fail.

Bug fixes
* A zero length file being extracted from an image would cause the application to crash. It now reports a failure, which the front end interprets as 'file not found'.
* Deleting a file from ADFS New Map, where the file was in zone 0, would not correctly update the free space map pointers. This showed itself whereby another file could then not be added, even to a blank disc.
* If a file failed to open (not recognised, for example), the controls would still be enabled and the filename put in the title bar.

1.05.12 6th February 2021
-------------------------
New or improved features
* Refreshed the graphics. All the RISC OS filetypes have been replaced with RISC OS 5.28 Raspberry Pi filetypes, and have increased from 50 types to 136 types.

1.05.13 8th February 2021
-------------------------
New or improved features
* New button for the file's CRC32 which copies it onto the clipboard.
* New tool bar button to save the image's files' details out to a CSV file.
* Changed how a disc is loaded in, IDed and read.
* When dragging and dropping a file in, it is IDed to see if it is an image. If it is, and there is already an image loaded, the application will ask if it is to be loaded or added to the current image.

Bug fixes
* If an ADFS New Map's file returned no fragments then it would crash when this file was extracted from the image.

1.05.14 18th February 2021
--------------------------
New or improved features
* Double clicking on a file will open it in as a hex dump. Hex dump routine is a cut down version of File Dump.
* Added new file context menu item, and File submenu item, to open file as a hex dump.

* New graphics for "Add Files", "Delete Files", "Extract Files", "Open Image", "Close Image", "New Directory", "Save As CSV" & "Free Space Map" buttons; "DEL" Commodore filetype & tree icon; and "HasChanged" icon on the status bar.
* Added the application icon to the About dialogue box.
* Only reports relevant information in the File Details panel.
* Rejigged the function to calculate an ADFS directory checksum, as the parameters being passed made calling it too complicated, when these parameters can be discovered by the function.
* Added function to repair detected broken ADFS directories.
* Can now extract files using the command line options.

Bug fixes
* The application would crash if a loaded ADFS New Map image had no free space fragments.
* When moving files within an image the original tree node was not removed.
* Added a detection for the key modifier, while dragging to copy/move, but the mouse is not moving.
* When dragging to copy/move, the destination would stay highlighted when the item was dragged back to it's parent.
* Right clicking (or double finger tapping) on an object to open the menu would also trigger the drag-drop operation.

1.05.15 27th February 2021
--------------------------
New or improved features
* When dragging and dropping items in the directory tree, the window will now autoscroll up or down if the cursor is close to the threshold.
* Removed the LoadFileFromStream method from the TDiscImage class.
* When a file is loaded it is inflated from GZip, if necessary.

1.05.16 - 15th March 2021
-------------------------
New or improved features
* Re-added and improved progress feedback when reading in an image.
* Now checks to see if file is GZ compressed before loading, speeding up the loading process.
* ADFS Big Directories - files and directories can now be written to, expanding or contracting as needed. *** UNTESTED ***
* Expanded command line option 'add' to specify the eventual filename, load address, execution address and attributes.
* Added new command line option 'dirtitle' to retitle a specified directory.
* Added new command line option 'access' to change the attributes on a specified file or directory.
* Expanded command line option 'save' to specifiy if a UEF is to be saved uncompressed, rather than the default compressed.

Bug fixes
* Fixed a bug I had created where a "Divide by zero" error would occur on new ADFS discs.
* Another bug that keeps cropping up is where the graphic for the Free Space Map (on the Image Details dialogue box) can grow beyond the capabilities of the compiler causing it to crash with really large images.
* If a single sided DFS disc is loaded with the 0xA00 area all zeros, it will wrongly detect it as a double sided disc.
* If a DFS file used bits 16 and 17 for the length, this was getting multiplied by 0x55 and wrongly reporting the file length. The same issue affected the execution and load addresses.
* Creating a new disc image, from the command line, did not set up any boot options so trying to change it will result in the application crashing.
* Creating a new disc image, changing the title or changing the boot option, from the command line, did not set the 'Has Changed' flag.

1.05.17 - 21st March 2021
-------------------------
New or improved features
* Tested and fixed ADFS Big Directory function to write files to a directory (after removing the lock I'd left on). Untested on root.
* ADFS Big Directories now expands and contracts when necessary.
* When adding files to ADFS New Maps, the search for free space fragments starts from the centre zone, and not zone zero.
* Can now rename files in an ADFS Big Directory. Untested on root.
* Split DFS dialogue box graphics changed slightly (source and destination drive 0 icons show a '0' while drive 2 icons show a '2').
* Zip files containing files (known as Spark archives in the application) can now be opened and the contents imported into a RISC OS ADFS image, preserving filetypes. This will only work with Zip archives.

Bug fixes
* Filetypes from imported files (as ,XXX in the filename) were not getting decoded correctly.
* Found that E+ and F+ ADFS floppy images were not getting initialised properly, putting the root in the same fragment as the system.
* The terminating CR character was not getting written for the directory name in ADFS Big Directories.
* Some files and directories where getting displayed with strange names when they contained 'top bit set' characters, particularly with ADFS Big Directory.
* Some features where failing with ADFS Big Directories because of the space character is stored with top bit set (i.e. 0xA0 instead of 0x20).
* ADFS attributes were having the 'WR' added on, even when not specified. This is now only used when nothing is specified.
* Updating the boot option or disc title was failing because of some odd logic.
* Deleting a zero length file, or one without any fragments, on an ADFS New Map would cause the application to crash.
* Attributes, apart from 'L', were getting ignored when importing files into ADFS.

1.05.18 - 25th March 2021

* Command line option 'extract' will now take wildcards.
* Pressing Enter on one of the search entry boxes initiates the search, in addition to clicking on the button.
* The search entry boxes, and the search results list, have been recoloured and text style changed.
* When selecting an item from the search results it does not immediately deselect itself.

Bug fixes
* The timeout part of uncompressing files was not working, so this has been re-written.

1.05.19 - 5th April 2021
------------------------
New or improved features
* Filetype graphics changed, again, for higher resolution graphics.
* Removed the second set of image lists and now just rely on the single list and scale as appropriate.
* Figured out how to make all the panels a uniform colour, then changed them so they are now textured.
* Toolbar graphics changed, again, for higher resolution graphics. Some icons have changed completely.
* Moved the File Search to a separate window, accessible via toolbar button or menu.
* Re-arranged the File Details panel. Only fields with entries are shown.
* Made the application 'High-DPI aware', so that, hopefully, the text and graphics grow and shrink as appropriate, as demanded by the OS.
* Added a panel splitter between the Image Contents and File Details panels.
* Reduced the size of the Image Contents and File Details title.
* Image Contents has new directory arrows, and different colours for items selected.

Bug fixes
* A bug was introduced in the last version where loading an ADFS image, in most cases, left it in an infinite loop.

1.20 - 8th April 2021
---------------------
New or improved features
* Change the version numbering. We are now at 1.20, from 1.05.19.
* Expands a file's load and execution address, when imported from DFS to ADFS, from FFxxxx to FFFFxxxx.
* When exporting a file, the inf file now has variable length hex addresses depending on the source filing system.
* When exporting an image's contents as a CSV, the hex addresses are now variable length, as per inf format.
* Hex Dump is now File Viewer.
* Show Hex Dump in the context menu is now Show File Contents.
* File Viewer will now show text, obey or BBC BASIC files as text on a separate tab.
* When exporting a file from DFS, which does not have a directory specifier, the root is added to the filename in the inf file.

Bug fixes
* Introduced a bug in 1.05.16 where the DFS load and execution addresses were 03xxxx instead of FFxxxx.
* Loading a DFS image, then creating a new ADFS S image caused the application to crash.
* The File Viewer did not always display the last line in the Hex Dump view.
* The initial directory arrow button did not appear when an entry is added to a new directory.

1.21 - 21st April 2021
----------------------
New or improved features
* Double clicking on a file, if it is recognised as a PNG, Bitmap or JPEG, is displayed alongside the Hex Dump of the same file.
* Double clicking on a sprite file will display the sprites alongside the Hex Dump.
* ADFS directories are now read in, in their entirety, and written back out, in their entirety using a directory cache. This gets around the issue of fractured ADFS directories which occur with Big Directories.
* The reading and writing of bytes (single, double, triple and quadruple - i.e. 8 to 32 bit lengths) has been improved.
* The extending of ADFS big directories has been disabled, for now. However, due to the using of a directory cache, the writing to such directories is now possible, as long as they do not need extending, which will return a fail.
* Creating a new, blank, ADFS image will now title the disc with a default name 'DiscImgMgr'.

Bug fixes
* Introduced a bug in 1.20 where some ADFS (and, possibly, other formats) images failed to open.
* The application has never been able to reliably read fractured directories from an Big Directory New Map image. A fix has been effected, which caused the above bug in the first place.

1.22 - 24th April 2021
----------------------
New or improved features
* Root address, for ADFS new map, is now reported in File Details as an indirect address instead of a direct address.
* Fixing ADFS directories now works on a cached copy of the directory before writing it all back.
* Now extends ADFS big directories, fragmenting them if necessary.
* Now contracts ADFS big directories. This copies the ADFS behaviour of leaving the original fragments as they were when bigger, but still reduces the directory size.
* Texture tiled the Sprite tab and image tab in the file viewer.
* BBC BASIC file viewer is now white text on blue background.
* Changed the way that ADFS files and directories are renamed and re-titled.

Bug fixes
* Found a bug where the ADFS new map wasn't being written correctly when objects were added.

1.23 - 26th April 2021
----------------------
New or improved features
* When a spark archive is added, a check is done to make sure that the contents will fit before commencing de-archiving. If it will not then the archive will just be added as is, assuming that will fit.

Bug fixes
* When importing the contents of a Spark archive (zip file), and the image gets full, the application would still attempt to add the rest of the files, sometimes corrupting the image. It now aborts the operation.
* The allocation of fragments for ADFS new map was not taking the minimum fragment size into account, and was also not sector aligning the objects. This resulted in some images being unreadable by ADFS and/or causing RISC OS to hang.
* Some sizes where not getting reported correctly, losing any initial zeros in the decimal part.

1.24 - 28th April 2021
----------------------
New or improved features
* Copying how ADFS assigns fragments, the application now tries to centralise fragments around the root, in a multi-zone ADFS new map image.
* Created a custom error/confirmation/message dialogue box in a RISC OS style.
* Reduced the initial size of the main form.

Bug fixes
* After re-titling a directory, saving the image, then either closing the application or closing the image, the application would still think that there are unsaved changes.
* The buttons in the Split DFS facility had got swapped round and then did not make sense.
* A bug was introduced in 1.23 where, when saving a UEF, the data block was not made big enough before trying to write some data, resulting in some parameters not being written correctly.
* On Windows, when a file was double clicked to open in the File Viewer, it also triggered the drag and drop copy operation in the directory tree.

1.25 - 9th May 2021
-------------------
New or improved features
* Tidied up some code dealing with saving UEF files.
* Can now create new, blank, ADFS hard drive images. Min size 20MB; max size 1000MB.
* A BBC BASIC file is now beautified.
* Added option for the command line to create an ADFS hard drive image.
* Resized the New Image dialogue box.
* Changed the buttons in the New Image dialogue to the 'RISC OS' style being used in the application, and swapped them around.
* Added image format, map type and directory type to the Image Details dialogue.
* Added a platform logo to the Image Details dialogue.
* Changed the buttons in Image Details dialogue to the 'RISC OS' style.
* Removed the 'Side 0' when the image only has a single side, in Image Details dialogue.
* Changed the filters in the Save dialogue boxes, and in the Open Image dialogue box.
* The filter in the Save Image dialogue box now matches the detected format of the currently open image.
* New DFS and Commodore images are now titled, as per ADFS.
* Speeded up the creation of the free space graphic(s).
* When Image Details is clicked, the cursor changes to an hourglass.
* The Progress window now shows the cursor as an hourglass.

Bug fixes
* UEF files were getting saved uncompressed by default. This has been changed to saving compressed by default.
* When checking multizone ADFS discs for free space, zone 0 was missed.

1.26 - 20th May 2021
--------------------
New or improved features
* Can now edit the load and execution addresses for ADFS,DFS and CFS files (click on the appropriate field).
* Improved the lookup for the filetype names, and added a method to lookup a filetype from a name.
* Added another 11 RISC OS filetypes to the list, bringing the total to 1218.
* Can now edit the filetype for a RISC OS ADFS file (click on the filetype or the graphic).
* Can now edit the timestamp for a RISC OS ADFS file (click on the time/date).
* Viewing a text file in the file viewer now uses a different container to viewing BASIC files.
* Clicking on the CRC32 number will copy it to the clipboard, briefly turning it blue to indicate this.
* The button to copy the CRC32 to clipboard has been removed.
* Hints have been added, indicating that a field is editable or copyable, to the various fields.
* Filename, Parent, Length, and Location can now be clicked on to copy to clipboard.

Bug fixes
* Corrected a few minor mistakes in the RISC OS filetype list.

1.27 - 29th May 2021
--------------------
New or improved features
* Improved the file opening/reading procedure.
* Made the progress window slightly bigger to completely cover the main window.
* Slightly re-jigged the procedure to download files from images.
* Application now captures CTRL+C and CTRL+V keystrokes (or CMD+C and CMD+V on macOS) for copying and pasting of files. However, there is no code behind this as yet.

Bug fixes
* There were still some DFS images that were failing checks.
* The Text Viewer tab, in the File Viewer window, was still visible even when not used.
* Some UEF files were not getting inflated properly and, hence, unreadable.
* Zero length files were not getting handled correctly from DFS images.

1.28 - 4th June 2021
--------------------
New or improved features
* Slight speed increase for reading in Spark files by not using the GUI. This means that the application will need to re-read in the image once done. This will depend on the number of files in the archive.
* When importing a Spark archive, all errors are skipped, but logged. Any errors will then be displayed after the import.
* Will try and detect a text file from the contents, and display as a text file in the File Viewer.
* Whether an ADFS L shape image is interleaved or not is now attempted to be detected based on the number of broken directories.
* Improved the Spark module. It now ignores the OS flag and looks for the ARC0 signature, as per David Pilling's !SparkFS. This means that previous archives that where the application did not preserve the load and execution address now does.
* Because of improvements to the Spark module, the application is now able to tell if the open image shape is suitable for the incoming archive contents and asks the user if they wish to proceed if not.
* When an image is opened (or new one created) the root node is automatically selected.

Bug fixes
* An ADFS Big Directory hard drive image created by Disc Image Manager would not be recognised by RISC OS.

1.29 - 15th June 2021
---------------------
New or improved features
* The Spark module will now import PackDir archives.
* The import of one image into another now uses the Error Log to report errors.
* New Preferences button and menu item to open a preferences dialogue box to set up some options - window texture; ADFS L interleaving.
* Changed the main menu item 'Tools' to 'Utilities' and 'Help' to 'Tools'.
* The ADFS/Amiga map type and directory details on the status bar are now blank if it is not an ADFS or Amiga image.
* Changed the hint for Open Image to "Open Existing Image".
* Changed the way that files were copied within the same image. It will now, by default, delete any file with the same name in the destination when copying a file, but fail if copying a directory. This is overridden by the GUI by renaming the file prior to executing the copy method in the class.
* Moving a file or directory will now fail if one of the same exists at the new destination.
* Opened up the copy method to copy a file to the same destination as the source.
* Pressing Escape will cancel a drag drop operation.
* Files can now be moved or copied in UEF files.
* Files can now be duplicated (copied) on the same side of a DFS image and on a Commodore image.
* Slight re-alignment when picking up a file to initiate a drag/drop copy/move operation.
* New toolbar button, main menu item, and context menu item: Duplicate File. Works just as dragging and dropping a file onto the same parent.
* When importing an image into another image, a dialogue box is opened to pick which files or directories to import.
* Moved the buttons on the Hard Drive selector dialogue.
* Changed the buttons on the Split/Combine DFS tool to be RISC OS orientated.
* Spark archives are now treated as a filing system (read only).
* The facility to check if the current open image would be suitable for the incoming import has now been extended to importing from all disc images.
* When adding a file to an image, if one of the same name exists already it will get overwritten (after confirmation from the user).
* When downloading files, the original selection would be restored.

Bug fixes
* Importing from one image to another would crash if the parent directory could not be found.
* Moving a file, while it is open in File Viewer, would result in the window title bar being updated to the parent of the file's new location, and not including the filename.
* It was possible to pick up the root directory and drag it into another folder to initiate a copy/move operation, which would then crash the application.
* Some file system format strings were being returned with an extraneous space at the end.
* The error reporting an invalid image when the user tries to load something not recognised stopped being reported a few versions ago. This has now returned.
* Selecting and then deleting multiple files ended up with only deleting half the selection, or crashing the application (if there were an odd number of files selected).
* When renaming a file to just change the case, an error was raised that the file already exists.
* Could not download the entire of the second side of a DFS image if the side 2 root is selected.
* Selecting addition objects would sometimes trigger off the drag/drop operation.
* On the Mac pressing CTRL with left mouse click to select an additional file would also bring up the context menu.

1.30 - 19th June 2021
---------------------
New or improved features
* Added more texture tiling options: RISC OS 3 style, Iyonix style and RISC OS Pi style.
* Increased the size of the preferences dialogue to accomodate the extra tiles.
* Can now read in Acorn FileStore Level 3 images, either on their own or as an ADFS partition.
* More tweaking of the ADFS ID functions to allow the detection of Acorn FileStore partitioned images, and to get the proper interleaving method for the image.
* ADFS image sizes below 800K, which are not 160K, 320K or 640K, are now marked as 'unknown' and given the extension 'dat' when saving.
* Added extra option in preferences to turn the logging of debug information on or off.
* Added extra command line option to turn the logging of debug information on or off.
* Clicking on the application icon in the About Box will report the debug log file's location.

Bug fixes
* When 'no tile' is selected, the filetype icon background would appear the wrong colour.
* ADFS ID process now recognises an Acorn FileStore Level 3 partition and no longer rejects the image as invalid despite having a valid ADFS partition.
* The application's icon in the About Box has always been hidden, since the porting to Lazarus.

1.31 - 27th June 2021
---------------------
New or improved features
* Added file extensions *.afs and *.zip to the Open Image dialogue box as options for Acorn FileStore and !Spark archives, as they were missing.
* The File Viewer window can now be resized on the BASIC viewer, Text viewer or Image viewer. It is still restricted on the Hex Dump viewer and Sprite viewer.
* The File Viewer window's size is now remembered, during the same session (but forgotten if the disc image is ejected).
* When viewing a text file, CR (0x0D) is now used as an end of line.
* When downloading a file from an image, the supplied filename is used if it is just the one file being downloaded.
* Change of format name from Acorn FileStore to Acorn FS (for Acorn File Server).
* Improved the ID-ing of Acorn ADFS and FS images to take account of the three types of interleaving.
* Changed the options for interleaving and added an extra one. There is now 'Automatic', 'Sequential', 'Interleaved', and 'Multiplexed'.
* Can now read in Acorn FS Level 2 images.

* Added facility to attempt to prevent the application going into an infinite loop when reading an Acorn FS image.

Bug fixes
* When changing the texture for the background, the main window was not being updated in Windows.
* The log file was produced whether the option in the preferences was set or not.
* When editing a filename and the mouse was moved away to do other operations, the edit box remained.

1.32 - 4th July 2021
--------------------
New or improved features
* With multi-partition (side) images, clicking on files or directories will change the total size, free space and disc title displays in the status bar to refer to that partition/side.
* ADFS/AFS hybrid images now has separate titles for both partitions, albeit the ADFS one is a default 'AFS L3'.
* Can now load DFS images that have MODE 7 control characters in the title (i.e. top bit set characters).
* Added a preferences option to allow DFS images where it specifies a zero number of sectors. Such images are then given a default size of 200K.
* Additional checks have been added to the ID process for DFS. Each file's location and length are checked against the reported disc length to make sure that they are on the disc. If no size is reported, 200K is assumed.
* Fixing ADFS directories will no longer attempt a fix on ADFS L images where the directory header and footer do not contain 'Hugo', and there are zero entries. This is because this could be caused by incorrect interleave option.
* Creating a blank ADFS L image now takes account of the interleave option in preferences.
* Can now create a blank Acorn FS Level 2 and 3 image (untested on real, or emulated, system).

Bug fixes
* Sometimes just clicking on a DFS root directory, or just generally in the directory listing but not over an entry, would cause the application to crash.
* When the texture is changed the old texture would still remain under the filetype graphic on the File Details pane.

1.33 - 10th July 2021
---------------------
New or improved features
* Finishing off the creating of Acorn FS Level 2 images, the number of free sectors and pointer to first free sector fields in the allocation map are now written to the allocation map.
* Finishing off the creating of Acorn FS Level 2 images, reserving sectors 1 and 801, as they are not used, are now written to the allocation map, and the position of the root and the two allocation maps adjusted accordingly.
* Finishing off the creating of Acorn FS Level 2 images, blank chains in the allocation map now skip over used sectors, and the map is now terminated correctly.
* The file extension is now used, for DFS images, to confirm whether single or double sided when the 'Allow Zero Length' options is set and it is unsure what to ID the image as.
* Added option when creating a new image to create password file for Acorn FS images.
* Added context menu item to create password file (currently disabled).
* Added context menu item to save partition (currenty disabled).
* Added context menu item to delete partition (currently disabled).
* Added main menu Partition and added Create Password File, Save Partition As, and Delete Partition to it (all currently disabled).
* Added keyboard shortcuts to the main and context menu items.
* Changed the way the free space map is calculated for Acorn FS.

* Can now add files to an Acorn FS Level 2 and Level 3 image.
* Can now add directories to an Acorn FS Level 2 and Level 3 image.
* Can now rename files on an Acorn FS Level 2 and Level 3 image.

Bug fixes
* AFS Level 2 images were wrongly created as multiplex interleaved.
* The extra checks on DFS images caused certain legitimate images to be rejected.
* The second side of a DS DFS image, where the reported sectors was zero, caused the image to be IDed as a SS image.
* The second side of a DS DFS image, where the first two sectors were zeros, caused the image to be IDed as a SS image.
* File lengths were not getting read correctly on Acorn FS Level 2 files.
* Load and Execution addresses where not getting displayed with Acorn FS files.
* There were some writes, specifically for ADFS and AFS, that would not happen because the application failed to find the parent directory. This was a bug introduced in an earlier version.
* When creating a directory in ADFS or Acorn FS the GUI would get 'confused' about who the parent of this new directory was. It seems that the appropriate flag and field where not getting updated. It would work OK if this image was then saved and re-opened.

1.34 - 17th July 2021
---------------------
New or improved features
* Added a couple of extra fields to the backend's directory records for parent and sector location.
* Deleting files and directories from an Acorn FS image is now possible.
* Added graphics for the four new menu items: Add Password File, Edit Password File, Save Partition and Delete Partition.
* Added buttons for the four new functions: Add Password File, Edit Password File, Save Partition and Delete Partition.
* Main form initial size increased to take account of the four new buttons.
* Directories now get expanded on Acorn File Server images if needed.

* Disc title for Acorn File Server and ADFS/AFS Hybrid images can now be changed.
* IDing for DFS now checks for blank filenames, and rejects images that have any.
* The Free Space display now shows the interleave type used, and hides any fields not in use for the format.
* Can now create new Acorn File Server images from the command line.

Bug fixes
* A bug was introduced in the previous version where some Old Map ADFS images would crash the application.
* Changed the code so that a potential bug, where a parent directory was renamed but the parent field of it's descendants were not updated, should not occur.
* Opening a file in File Viewer, where the filename has top-bit set characters, caused the application to crash.
* Adding of files to an Acorn FS Level 3 image never updated the free space map.
* The Acorn FS Level 2 free space map was sometimes not updated correctly, due to the wrong map size being recorded in the header.
* A bug was introduced in an recent version where downloading files, particularly a selection of files, resulted in the complete image path being given as the filename.
* If a file, on a Commodore image, had a dot '.' as part of the name then this would fail to be found. This means that operations such as downloading would not work.
* An AFS Level 2 image, where the headers do not match, were getting IDed as a DFS image.

1.35 - 1st August 2021
----------------------
New or improved features
* Added a window for editing the Acorn FS 'Passwords' file, and enabled the button.
* Password files for Acorn FS images can now be edited.
* Enabled the button to create a new password file.

* Changed the main menu to reflect the new grouping in the toolbars.
* Delete Partition now works for DS DFS images (producing SS DFS images) and ADFS Hybrid (producing either ADFS or Acorn FS images).
* Save Partition now works for DS DFS images (producing SS DFS images) and ADFS Hybrid (producing either ADFS or Acorn FS images).
* Slight change to the format strings for Acorn ADFS Hybrid images.
* Two single sided DFS images can now be combined to form a double sided image, away from the Split/Combine DFS utility.
* Split/Combine DFS button, and menu item, removed from the toolbar and main menu, along with the Utilities menu.
* Functions to do with Partitions and AFS Password files removed from the File context menu.
* Added the function to Add Partition to ADFS 8 bit images, along with the corresponding menu item and tool bar button.
* Improved the free space calculation with Acorn FS partitions.

Bug fixes
* Deleting a file in Acorn FS Level 3 did not release the object header sector.
* Reading the second side of a double sided DFS image would read the filenames from the first side.

* On import, the Import Selector dialogue takes account of which side/partition is being imported to and automatically selects the appropriate side/partition on the incoming image, if appropriate.
* Implemented Change Interleave for ADFS and AFS.
* Added command line options for defrag and change interleave.

Bug fixes
* The Import Selector dialogue did not include a tick box for the second side/partition of a double sided DFS, or an ADFS/AFS Hybrid.
* When adding files (specifially multi-zoned ADFS New Map), some would fail to write because the application was trying to write them off the end of the partition.
* Deletions, additions and renames were not working on the Acorn FS partition of a hybrid image.
* Writes, where the file would get fragmented, was not implemented. This was because the function which allocates fragments had not been fully completed to account for fragmenting an object.

1.37 - 4th September 2021
-------------------------
New or improved features
* Can now read MS-DOS and DOS Plus images and partitions.
* Changed the AmigaDOS root name to 'DF0:'.
* Added new filetype graphics for Commodore 64 files.
* Added a new graphic for non-Acorn and non-Commodore 64 files.

Bug fixes
* There was a potential for the application to crash when reading the Acorn FS free space map.
* When an ADFS/AFS Hybrid image was open, the ADFS attribute panel was shown whether an ADFS or AFS object was selected.
* The wrong icons were getting used for Acorn File Server files.

* Added radio boxes to the "Add Partition" dialogue for Acorn File Server and DOS Plus.
* Changed the title bar for "Add Partition" from 'AFS Partition Size' to just 'Partition Size'.
* Tiled the "Add Partition" dialogue, as it had been missed previously.
* Different directory separators are now specified with ADFS/DOS hybrids.

Bug fixes
* When reading in a DOS Plus directory, if the first character of the filename is 0x05 this is now replaced with 0xE5 instead of just skipping the entry.
* DOS Directories were read direct from the data instead of being read into a buffer. This could result in the directory not being read correctly, particularly if it was fragmented.
* The function to determine if a cluster number was valid sometimes returned a false positive.
* Writes to an Acorn FS or DOS Plus partition of an ADFS hybrid sometimes failed to work correctly.
* At some point in a previous version, the root name 'dropped' off the parent property for ADFS files. This meant that the search results returned files with the root missing from the pathname and therefore unable to locate when clicked on.

1.39 - 26th February 2022
-------------------------
New or improved features
* When the root directory is selected, the 'Directory Title' field now reads 'Disc Title' and changing the text will update the disc title of the image, instead of failing with Acorn DFS.
* The Display Free Space button's hint text has been changed to 'View/Edit Image Details' to more accurately reflect the dialogue box.
* Extended the ADFS interleave options beyond ADFS 'L'. Forcing an interleave option will use that option for any ADFS format, not just 'L'.
* Can now change the interleave method for any ADFS image, if the interleave is forced using the options (i.e., not automatic).
* Compiled using Lazarus version 2.2 which should fix some bugs outside the control of the author.

* Adjusted the Acorn FS Level 3 slider when creating new images to be more accurate.
* Added in some extra code to read in copy protected Elite tape images, and others using a similar protection.
* Restricted the maximum AFS L3 size to be 128MB-1, until I work out the different format introduced in 1988 by Acorn.

Bug fixes
* Creating a double sided DFS image failed to work.
* Creating a Watford DFS image failed to work.
* When the ADFS filename is shorter than the available characters required for the attributes, not all the attributes were read in. This manifested itself with a directory entry shorter than 4 characters.
* Importing files with a filename longer than allowed were still getting added to DFS and UEF images.
* An extra byte (NUL) was added to UEF files when saving, causing some emulators to get confused.
* The ID process still checked images even if it had already been identified.
* The maximum size for an Acorn FS Level 2 image is 1MB, not 512MB. The selector has been adjusted accordingly.
* When reading the header for an Acorn FS Level 3 image, the incorrect disc size was read. Anything over 16.7MB was read incorrectly.
* Some areas of the file details panel on the main window were not getting repainted correctly with the selected tile.

1.40 - 28th March 2022
----------------------
New or improved features

* Added the ability to create a blank DOS Hard Drive image (FAT12/FAT16/FAT32).
* Improved the separation of the ADFS partition from a hybrid image.
* Improved the separation of the DOS partition from a hybrid image. This will not result in a viable image when a DOS partition does not exist on the source partition.

Bug fixes
* The incorrect OS and CPU where reported in the About dialogue for macOS ARM.
* The incorrect keyboard shortcuts were used for macOS ARM.
* A Watford DFS double sided image would get incorrectly IDed as an Acorn DFS double sided image if both sides were different sizes.
* Sometimes the file info panel would not get fully repainted.
* When saving an image, some filters where not added.
* The DOS part of a 640KB ADFS/DOS partition was not getting read correctly.

* Changed the error reported on failure to download.
* Improved the detection of FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32, based on Microsoft spec.
* Added new filetypes, and extra filters on the Open Image dialogue box, for FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32.

Bug fixes
* The Hard Drive image creator dialogue box would not always produce an exact sized image. E.g., a 64MB image would not always be exactly 64MB in size.
* The correct directory separator is now used with ADFS/DOS hybrid images.
* Acorn/Watford DFS, Commodore 64, Acorn CFS and Spark images were being opened with the 'directory been read' flag not set, so appeared as if the directories were unread.
* DFS images were still not correctly being IDed.

1.42 - 23rd April 2022
----------------------

* If the directory entry, in a SparkFS archive, appeared after any of it's child entries, then these child entries would not get shown in the directory tree.
* A bug had crept in, at some earlier version, that crashed the application when the filetype was clicked on.
* When editing the date/time stamp, clicking on a field during editing would instead commence editing the selected node on the directory tree for renaming.

1.43 - 4th May 2022
-------------------
New or improved features
* Reports number of items in a directory in the File Details pane.

* Added a command line option to change the configuration options: --config or -cf.

Bug fixes
* When looking for a DOS partition on an ADFS hard drive, the drive was split as two separate drives. However, the DOS partition is a file held within the ADFS file structure and not a separate partition.
* The custom filetype entry box was not positioned correctly in the filetype dialogue.
* ADFS Filetypes and timestamps were getting reported for non ADFS formats and ADFS Old Directories.
* Sometimes reading a file off an AmigaDOS image would hang the application.
* During copy/move operations, the directory being hovered over expanded instantly which could cause issues. There is now a 1 sec hover delay before expanding.
* A failed delete, or the user clicking on 'No' to confirm a deletion, would leave the confirmation window open until it was a successful delete, or the user clicked 'Yes'.
* The configuration option to compress UEF images did not get saved to the registry.

1.44 - 18th December 2022
-------------------------
New or improved features
* Added a new class for accessing the registry.

* ADFS broken directory error codes have been expanded. Now checks for non-sector aligned directories, invalid Start or End names (i.e. not 'Hugo' or 'Nick'), and any other reason it is found to be broken.
* When adding multiple files to an image, no format checking is done and the files are just added.
* When adding directories to an image, the progress indicator is shown.
* When IDing DFS images, any image over 400KB (200KB double sided) is rejected.
* Added the address of the file to the CSV output.
* Extra range checking when updating ADFS New Map fragments, and if any part fails, the original is restored from the backup.
* Moved the 'Waiting' and 'Progress Update' labels on the Progress dialogue window.
* Performed some code optimisation on ADFS New Map.
* Writing objects to ADFS New Map will now create, or re-use, shared fragments.
* When outputting a CSV file of the contents, a dialogue box is now presented to select which columns, with some options, are to be included.
* CSV output now prefixes all hex numbers with '0x' for easier importing into Excel/Numbers/etc.
* Added 'Show Report' button and window.
* Image report can also be included in the CSV output.
* ADFS Hardware information is now saved into hard drive images (ADFS New Map).

Bug fixes
* In ADFS and Acorn FS, if a file had the same sector as the root then the filename would be blank. This would usually happen with New Map ADFS (usually an 'E' floppy) where the root was addressed directly, but the files were addressed indirectly.
* Changing time/date on a file now updates the 'unsaved' icon in the status bar.
* Some ADFS New Map fragment IDs were being used more than once, so the checking on unique IDs has been tightened up.
* The ADFS disc size was being read in as the root size.
* The heads and sectors per track fields were not being read in with ADFS New Map.
* Sometimes the root on ADFS New Map was not being found, so this has been improved.
* Renaming a directory in ADFS caused issues when then adding files to it as it kept it's old name.
* Sometimes when writing a file on ADFS New Map, two (or more) files would have the same indirect address (fragment ID).
* When writing a file to ADFS New Map, the end of free space marker on a zone would be beyond the zone and trample the following zone. When subsequent files where then written, this would continue into the following zone(s).
* On ADFS New Map, the free space would sometimes be incorrectly reported meaning that some files were stored where there was not enough space to store the file.
* On ADFS New Map, the smallest possible space to contain a fragment ID and the stop bit was not taken into consideration, meaning that a file stored could then not be retrieved.
* Some ADFS New and Big directory object's attributes, that only had a single attribute, were having '00' appended to the end.

1.45 - 3rd March 2023
---------------------
New or improved features
* Removed the file type filter from the 'Add Files' dialogue box.
* Rewrote the function to reconsolidate the ADFS Old Map Free Space Map, sorting entries into order and removing unused ones.
* Styled the application more towards RISC OS style.
* Changed the toolbar on the main window to tabbed toolbars, as the 'coolbars' were not scaling correctly.
* Now creates an 'inf' file for the root directory when extracting to the host system.
* The 'inf' file created for directories now includes an extra field for the directory title.
* Made the scroll bars for the directories display now automatic. Now, they only appear when required.

Bug fixes
* Adding files to an ADFS Old Map would sometimes result in a 'Bad FS Map' when read by the MOS.
* When displaying an ADFS disc, the root directory title would be replaced with the disc name instead.
* When displaying BBC BASIC files, line numbers (after GOTO, RESTORE, GOSUB, etc.) were not getting displayed.
* Ignored the attribute setting, from an 'inf' file, when importing directories.
* Defrag would lose all the sub-directory's entries.
* Updating the free space map of an old map ADFS would blank off the root directory's 'StartSeq' number thereby causing a Broken Directory for the root.
* Deleting objects, from Old Map ADFS, did not update the Free Space Map correctly all the time. This was mostly noticable on Defrag when many files got lost because of lack of space.
* Deleting a directory, in ADFS, did not remove the reference from the internal array. The resultant image was usually unaffected.
* After a defrag, the application would sometimes crash for no apparent reason.
* The modified icon on the Image Details status bar was not being scaled correctly.
* The Image Details status bar was not getting fully repainted after a non-saved image was closed.
* The application would crash if an ADFS image had zero free space.
* Creating a 640KB ADFS L image, then adding a DOS partition would not result in the partition being visible.

1.45.1
---------------------
New or improved features
* Image report now lists the free space map for ADFS.

Bug fixes
* When deleting directories, the internal directory references were not getting updated.
* When deallocating free space on a New Map ADFS, the wrong idlen was sometimes being used.
* The New Map ADFS free space map was not getting read correctly.
* Renaming an ADFS file in a ADFS/DOS hybrid image could crash the application on Windows. Renames on the DOS or Acorn FS side could also fail.
