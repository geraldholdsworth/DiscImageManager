To Do

In no particular order

Bugs
* Some SS DFS images are IDed as DS images when 'Allow zero sectors' is selected in the preferences. - UNABLE TO REPLICATE
* Access violation has been reported when creating an ADFS HDD image (default options) on Windows. - UNABLE TO REPLICATE

General - Ideas, currently unlikely to be added
* Drag and Drop facilities out of the application...currently looking unlikely for cross platform. This will need to be done using 'code-per-platform' directives.
* Extend drag and drop copy/move to multiple selection.
* Application to application communications.
* Copy entire files onto clipboard? And then paste from clipboard? - as Drag and Drop, this will need to be done using 'code-per-platform' directives.

General - Ideas which are maybe possible
* Ask to force overwrite if many files are getting written.
* Export the contents of an open image to another image, or set of images if the selected format is too small or are more directory entries than the format allows. - VERSION 2?
* Cancel button for progress display?
* Open multiple images at the same time and allow interaction between them (e.g. copying files from one to another). - VERSION 2
* For macOS, change the settings being saved to the registry to being saved in a plist file, or within the application directory itself.
* Allow for multiple (>2) partitions - i.e. two or more DOS partitions on an ADFS structure, or ADFS/AFS/DOS hybrid. - VERSION 2
* ADFS: When a DOS image file is added to an ADFS image (and the "Open DOS Partition" setting is set), automatically open as the second partition (if there isn't one already).
* ADFS: Rebuild the Old Map FS Map by scanning the files and rebuilding from scratch (in the class definition).
* ADFS: Use the above, along with other functions, to create a new function to fix ADFS Old Map images which otherwise won't load.
* AFS: AFS0 images do not get created correctly (in particular the free space allocation maps) - AWAITING MORE INFO ON AFS FORMATS.
* AFS: Add option to new Level 3 images for pre-1988 or post-1988 format - AWAITING MORE INFO ON AFS FORMATS.
* AFS: When extracting the AFS partition, remove the ADFS partition and re-address all the objects, instead of just blanking out the ADFS part - IN PROGRESS.
* AFS: Consolidate the JesMap fragments which are concurrent (as per Old Map ADFS).
* AFS: Expand the reading of objects to include the extended JesMap.
* AFS/ADFS: Change the size of the ADFS partition.
* Amiga: Add in support for Rigid Disks (multi-partition hard discs) - NEED TO IMPLEMENT MULTI-PARTITION SUPPORT FIRST...VERSION 2.
* Amiga: Add in support for Professional File System - AWAITING FORMAT DETAILS AND SAMPLE(S).
* Amiga: Add in support for Smart File System - AWAITING SAMPLE(S).
* Spectrum/Amstrad: Write entire module - REQUIRE MORE INFO ON SPECTRUM FORMAT.
* MMFS: Rewrite/rethink entire MMFS idea - might be more viable once multi-partitions are implemented.
* DOS: Add in support for partitioned hard drive images - NEED TO IMPLEMENT MULTI_PARTITION SUPPORT FIRST...VERSION 2.
* CFS and ROM FS: Validate new filename when renaming.
* Have different TImageList components for each format.
* Function (and button) to consolidate the free space map for ADFS and AFS (using the functions built into the class).
* Hex editor: Editable.
* macOS: Dark mode - PARTIAL: Import image contents still needs to be looked at).
* Console: add commands: split/join - to add or remove sides/partitions.
* Move the code for compacting an image from the GUI code to the class code.
* Add RiscOS ISO format (and general ISO format).
